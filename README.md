### Phonotactics

This conlang follows a (C)(C)V(C) syllable structure, where:

* The second consonant (if present) must be a liquid or a trill (i.e., [l], [r]).
* \[ŋ\] cannot occur as an onset consonant.
* \[&#x200b;x\] cannot occur as a coda consonant.

### Allophones

* [sj] turns into [ʃ] (as in [sj] → [ʃ])
* [zj] turns into [ʒ] (as in [zj] → [ʒ]).
* [tj] turns into [tʃ] (as in [tj] → [tʃ]).
