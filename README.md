### Phonotactics

This conlang follows a (C)(S)V(S)(n) syllable structure, where:

* C (the initial consonant) can be any consonant from the provided chart, including stops, fricatives, or approximants (e.g., [p], [t], [n], [s], [f], [w]).
* S (the semivowel) is optional and can only be [j] or [w], but only one semivowel is allowed per syllable.
* If there is a semivowel after the first consonant, the consonant cannot be a semivowel.
* If the vowel is [i] or [u], the semivowel cannot be [j] or [u].
* V (the vowel) can be any of the five vowels in the system: [a], [i], [u], [e], [o].
* n (the nasal) is optional and can appear only at the end (coda) of a syllable.
* A syllable must contain at least one vowel.
